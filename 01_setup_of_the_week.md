# Setup of the week
The experiments started on Monday morning with a webinar on WFS 3 / OGC API Features and information on the workweek. After the webinar, interested participants could (remotely) start with the experiments they favored. During the week people from PDOK / Dutch Kadaster and Geonovum worked on their own implementations and supported others with their experiments through Github and Gitter. On Thursday morning an integration session / more technical with a smaller group was held. In the afternoon an (open) seminar in Utrecht was held (around 50 attendees), to share knowledge about WFS 3, showcase implementations of all participants and discuss experiences.
