# Unfinished business
The topics below have not been (fully) researched yet, but are considered relevant:
1. INSPIRE and OGC API Features: in general, most INSPIRE requirements could be fulfilled with OGC API Features. There are some (potential) issues to resolve, in the OGC spec, but also in the INSPIRE discussion paper. For example: CRS support, multilingual support and how to deal with the download of an entire dataset. See the [details of a first assessment](https://geonovum.github.io/wfs3-experiments/docs/INSPIREDownloadService.html).
1. Linked Data: to support linked data as output from a OGC API Features implementation, JSON-LD seems promising. A first example has been found. How to provide useful linked data and what should / could be part of the OGC API Features spec (in an extension probably), is still to be determined.
1. Security has not been addressed yet
1. how OGC API Features compares to the Dutch API Strategy has not been addressed yet.
