    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      In the first week of June 2019 PDOK and Geonovum organized a week of experiments on WFS 3 (formally called OGC API Features now), called (in Dutch): “WFS 3 werkweek”. The goal of this week was to acquire and share knowledge and experiences on WFS 3. Several Dutch organizations participated in the experiments and closing session.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document summarizes the lessons learned from this week: what works well, what is unclear or work to be done and what (possible) issues have been identified when working with OGC API Features.
